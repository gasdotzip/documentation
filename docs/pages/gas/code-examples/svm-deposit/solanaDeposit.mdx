# Code Example for Solana Deposit

Below are example implementations for setting up and executing deposits into the Gas.zip Solana deposit program.

Deposits using the Solana method must include instruction data defining the output chains and destination address.
Use the example code for an up-to-date spec of how to format the instruction data.

<Callout type="info">
The instruction data format consists of:
- Program discriminator (8 bytes)
- Value in lamports (u64) 
- Array of destination chain IDs (vec\<u16\>)
- Destination address (32 bytes)

The destination address handling:
- EVM addresses: 20 bytes padded with leading zeros to 32 bytes
- Solana addresses: 
  - Regular addresses: Decoded from base58 to 32 bytes
  - Program Derived Addresses (PDAs): First byte removed, last 8 bytes (bump seed) removed, padded if needed
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
Currently supported VM types for destination chains include: EVM, Solana, Fuel, Tron, Sui, and Aptos. Other VM types (Initia, XRP, etc.) are not supported at this time.
</Callout>
