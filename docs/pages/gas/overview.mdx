# Overview

The Gas.zip gas refuel bridge supports over 300+ destination chains and 25 source chains. The primary function from a user's perspective is depositing, where you send native assets to a Gas.zip EOA address along with specific calldata to distribute funds among your desired destination chains.

## Depositing to Gas.zip (v2)

Each inbound source chain has a designated EOA address that can accept the chain's native gas asset (e.g. ETH, AVAX, BNB, MATIC) between $0.25 USD and $50.00 USD. Gas uses the CoinGecko API for real-time coin price calculations.

:::warning
**WARNING:** Do not send less than $0.25 USD or more than $50.00 USD **PER CHAIN** to the deposit address. Please contact us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/gasdotzip) via a support ticket if you have accidentally done so.
:::

To make a deposit, you must include calldata specifying the destination chains and target recipient address. The destination address can be different from the sending address. The destination chain IDs are **not** the native chain IDs of each blockchain, but internal IDs designated by Gas.zip. Please see [Chain Support](/gas/chain-support/outbound) for this list of chain IDs.
