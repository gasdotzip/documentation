# Overview

Gas LayerZero is a gas refuel bridge built on the LayerZero protocol. You can instantly bridge to all supported LayerZero destination chains with a single inbound transaction.

## Depositing to Gas LayerZero v2

All `sendDeposits()` calls into the Gas LayerZero contract and must be encoded as a `uint256` where the leftmost 16 bits are the destination chain ID and the rightmost 240 bits are the amount (in `wei`) you'd like to recieve on the destination chain.

### Example of Process

1. **Select the Source Chain**: Start by selecting your source chain to deposit from.

2. **Select the Destination Chains**: Select your destination chains to recieve funds. In the [example](/layerzero/v2/code-examples/completeFlow), these are Gnosis (v2 LZ chain ID 30145) and Fuse (v2 LZ chain ID 30138).

3. **Select the Amount**: Decide the amount of native currency you want to send to each chain. In the [example](/layerzero/v2/code-examples/completeFlow), 0.000002 ETH is the amount bridged to both Gnosis and Fuse. The Ether input for each chain must be converted to Wei.

4. **Estimate Fees**: Call the `estimateFees()` function with the correct parameters. This function takes three arguments: `v2LZids`, `messages` and `options`. The aggregated return from `estimateFees()` is used as a parameter in `sendDeposits()`.

5. **Check Wallet Balance**: Ensure your wallet balance exceeds the estimated fees plus the total value in Wei, else the contract will revert due to insufficent funds.

6. **Proceed with the Transaction**: After all the checks, proceed with the transaction by calling the `sendDeposits()` function with the correct parameters.

:::warning
**IMPORTANT:** `estimateFees()` must be called prior to every time you call `sendDeposits()`.

:::warning
**IMPORTANT:** Every route combination has a specifc maximum it can send/recieve on the other side. If you exceed this amount, the contract will revert.
